# ppd-inflammation-ssri
Documents, Poster and code in R, for work done at CAMH (Centre of Addiction and Mental Health). This investigation is centered around how neuroinflammation impairs SSRI efficacy in a postpartum depression (PPD) model, and whether IL-1 receptor blockade can restore antidepressant‚Äêdriven coping behaviors. This repository includes an e-poster, graphs included in the poster, and a document explaining the background in depth.
